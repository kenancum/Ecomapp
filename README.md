# Ecomapp

Flutter project for my thesis.

## About the project

  The everyday life of each of us is full of different kinds of consumption, hence refuses. Since these two activities are strongly related to each other, the issue of the waste management process is rising with the number of used products. The recycling process takes one of the most significant roles in the world's wellbeing. Humanity needs to reduce the amount of waste produced not just to follow trends of an eco-friendly lifestyle, but also to prevent environmental catastrophe in the place we all live. 

Most of the wealthy industrialized countries already have implemented necessary regulations to control the waste flow and run the right recycling process on the governmental level. As described in [20] approximately 40% reported participation in the curbside recycling program, and nearly 20% more claimed that their household had been recycling in other ways. But the rest of the world still needs an approach to handle this issue in a simple and easy to learn manner. 

  The idea of this thesis is to bring the solution to the problem described above. First of all, we illustrate the problem of the whole world, while emphasizing the attention on industrializing countries and smaller areas, since that is our target group. The second and main part of the thesis is to design and develop an application, representing an interactive real-time map of recycling places in chosen locations. The reasons why we selected this topic are evident, but we would mention the main and most important ones: 
  
  ● Building a strong digital interaction between technology and people,
  
  ● Spreading an efficient and effective way of the eco-friendly lifestyle,
  
  ● Reducing unwanted and unrecognized produced waste. 

  On the one hand, we are focusing on the theoretical research itself and demonstration of different techniques of solving this problem, comparing them with each other and choosing our tools to use in the project. On the other hand, we are concentrating on the development and implementation of the application. This also includes an explanation and interpretation of methodologies and methods taken as the base for the thesis.
